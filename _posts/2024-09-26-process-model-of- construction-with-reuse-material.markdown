description: A circular economy could reduce global CO2 emissions from building materials by 38% in 2050 by reducing demand for steel, aluminum, cement, and plastic. It could also make the sector more resilient to supply chain disruptions and price volatility of raw materials. (Romnée et al., 2020). # Add post description (optional)

## Learning from case studies
  Soft demolition is the process of dismantling structures to enable materials to be salvaged or reuse. Accroding to the Delta institute report in a whole home deconstruction plan, up to 25% of materials can be reused, and up to 70% of materials can be recycled.

Not all materials Not all materials and components are easily dismantled, particularly in existing buildings where they were not originally intended for disassembly.
There some characteristics identified on feasibilities of the deconstruction these are: expected 
durability of components, toxicity, and hazardousness, the possibility of reutilizing materials, 
damage to connected parts, damage to connections, separation of construction materials, space for 
equipment and maneuvering, space for correct storage of construction materials, risk assessment and the 
adoption of security measures, disassembly procedure, As-Built drawings, design for disassembly strategies 
adopted at the design stage. (Machado et al., 2018)   

> soft demolition brings the opportunity for communities to reclaim economic, social, and environmental benefits, including: 
>-	Reduce toxic from the job site
>-	Reduce waste that goes to landfills
>-	Reduce consumption of virgin material
>-	Create jobs, especially for hard-to-employ
>-	Sale of value added products
>-	Potential for workforce training
>-	Potential for locally reclaimed material to be used in the restoration and   preservation of historic structures

## A process model for construction with reuse material
The process of construction using reused materials can vary significantly depending on the construction strategy of each company and the regulations in different countries. By examining various case studies, the primary model in Fig. 5 illustrates the general sequence of steps involved. However, this sequence is not always consistent. For example, in one case, testing and approval were conducted before dismantling the components, whereas in another case, these steps occurred after the components were transferred to the warehouse (Fig. 6).
Furthermore, the order of steps may change in projects where components are stored at a location near the project site, eliminating the need for warehouse transportation and rental (Fig. 7). This adjustment simplifies the process by skipping the transportation and warehouse rental stages altogether.
