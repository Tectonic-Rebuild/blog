title: Possible future to reuse building material
date: 2024-09-26 16:41:20 +0300
description: A circular economy could reduce global CO2 emissions from building materials by 38% in 2050 by reducing demand for steel, aluminum, cement, and plastic. It could also make the sector more resilient to supply chain disruptions and price volatility of raw materials. (Romnée et al., 2020). # Add post description (optional)

 The circular economy in construction is based on three main axes: 

* “Design and build circular” i.e., design construction with the end of the cycle in mind: design and build with adaptability in mind, build in layers, select materials according to their end of life and their impact on the environment (over the entire life cycle), make material assemblies accessible and reversible, and minimize waste production. 

* Practice “urban mining” by considering buildings as material resources, maintaining a maximum of constructive elements for as long as possible,  carefully deconstructing the elements, practicing remanufacturing or reusing, and then recycling. 

* Develop new “business models” that enable joint local value creation, such as developing local channels for maintenance, repair, and keeping goods in circulation. 


## Demolition or Deconstruction
  Soft demolition is the process of dismantling structures to enable materials to be salvaged or reuse. Accroding to the Delta institute report in a whole home deconstruction plan, up to 25% of materials can be reused, and up to 70% of materials can be recycled.

Not all materials Not all materials and components are easily dismantled, particularly in existing buildings where they were not originally intended for disassembly.
There some characteristics identified on feasibilities of the deconstruction these are: expected 
durability of components, toxicity, and hazardousness, the possibility of reutilizing materials, 
damage to connected parts, damage to connections, separation of construction materials, space for 
equipment and maneuvering, space for correct storage of construction materials, risk assessment and the 
adoption of security measures, disassembly procedure, As-Built drawings, design for disassembly strategies 
adopted at the design stage. (Machado et al., 2018)   

> soft demolition brings the opportunity for communities to reclaim economic, social, and environmental benefits, including: 
>-	Reduce toxic from the job site
>-	Reduce waste that goes to landfills
>-	Reduce consumption of virgin material
>-	Create jobs, especially for hard-to-employ
>-	Sale of value added products
>-	Potential for workforce training
>-	Potential for locally reclaimed material to be used in the restoration and   preservation of historic structures

## Circular Construction and Reuse Background in Finland
At this moment, the reuse of construction products is not a mainstream practice in Finland.
It is anticipated that the upcoming reform of the Construction Act will establish necessary minimum 
requirements for sustainable and circular construction
